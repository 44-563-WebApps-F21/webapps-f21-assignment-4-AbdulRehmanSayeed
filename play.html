        <h3>Act-1 The Terrace at Hunstanton Chase<br>
            The play opens with a party on a terrace in Lady Hunstanton's estate. The upper class guests spend the better part of Act I exchanging social gossip and small talk. 
            Lady Caroline Pontefract patronises an American visitor, Hester Worsley, and proceeds to give her own opinion of everyone in the room.

        [SIR JOHN _and_ LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, _on chairs under
large yew tree_.]<br>
LADY CAROLINE.  I believe this is the first English country house you
have stayed at, Miss Worsley?<br>
HESTER.  Yes, Lady Caroline.<br>
LADY CAROLINE.  You have no country houses, I am told, in America?<br>
HESTER.  We have not many.<br>
LADY CAROLINE.  Have you any country?  What we should call country?<br>
HESTER.  [_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady
Caroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as
big as France and England put together.<br>
LADY CAROLINE.  Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.
[_To_ SIR JOHN.]  John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of
my always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?<br>
SIR JOHN.  I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.<br>
LADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more
charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively
damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a
little lax about the people she asks down here.  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  Jane
mixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high
distinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of
Parliament, Mr. Kettle—<br>
SIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.<br>
