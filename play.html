        <h3>Act-1 The Terrace at Hunstanton Chase<br>
            The play opens with a party on a terrace in Lady Hunstanton's estate. The upper class guests spend the better part of Act I exchanging social gossip and small talk. 
            Lady Caroline Pontefract patronises an American visitor, Hester Worsley, and proceeds to give her own opinion of everyone in the room.

       <p class="stage-direction"> [SIR JOHN _and_ LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, _on chairs under
large yew tree_.]</p>
<p><h6 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6> </p> <P class="lady_caroline speech">I believe this is the first English country house you
    have stayed at, Miss Worsley?</p>
<h6 class="name">HESTER.</h6> <p class="hester speech"> Yes, Lady Caroline.</p>
<h6 class="name">LADY CAROLINE. </h6><p class="lady_caroline speech"> You have no country houses, I am told, in America?</p>
<h6 class="name"> HESTER.</h6><p class="hester speech">  We have not many.</p>
<h6 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6><p class="lady_caroline speech">  Have you any country?  What we should call country?</p>
<p><h6 class="name">HESTER.</h6> <p class="hester speech">[_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady
    Caroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as
    big as France and England put together.</p>
<h6 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6> <p class="lady_caroline speech"> Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.
    [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of
    my always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?</p>
<h6 class="name">SIR JOHN.</h6><p class="sir_john speech">  I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.</p>
<h6 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p class="lady_caroline speech">I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more
    charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively
    damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a
    little lax about the people she asks down here.  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  Jane
    mixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high
    distinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of
    Parliament, Mr. Kettle—</p>
<h6 class="name">SIR JOHN.</h6> <p class="sir_john speech"> Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.</p>
