        <h3>Act-1 The Terrace at Hunstanton Chase<br>
            The play opens with a party on a terrace in Lady Hunstanton's estate. The upper class guests spend the better part of Act I exchanging social gossip and small talk. 
            Lady Caroline Pontefract patronises an American visitor, Hester Worsley, and proceeds to give her own opinion of everyone in the room.

        [SIR JOHN _and_ LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, _on chairs under
large yew tree_.]
<p><h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  I believe this is the first English country house you
    have stayed at, Miss Worsley?</p>
<p><h6>HESTER.</h6>  Yes, Lady Caroline.</p>
<p><h6>LADY CAROLINE. </h6> You have no country houses, I am told, in America?</p>
<p><h6> HESTER.</h6>  We have not many.</p>
<p><h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  Have you any country?  What we should call country?</p>
<p><h6>HESTER.</h6>  [_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady
    Caroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as
    big as France and England put together.</p>
<p><h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.
    [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of
    my always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?</p>
<p><h6>SIR JOHN.</h6>  I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.</p>
<p><h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more
    charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively
    damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a
    little lax about the people she asks down here.  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  Jane
    mixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high
    distinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of
    Parliament, Mr. Kettle—</p>
<p><h6>SIR JOHN.</h6>  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.</p>
