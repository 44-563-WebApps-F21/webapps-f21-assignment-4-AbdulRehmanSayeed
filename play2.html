   <h6 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p class="lady_caroline speech">He must be quite respectable.  One has never heard his
name before in the whole course of one’s life, which speaks volumes for a
man, nowadays.  But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.</p>

<h6 class="name">HESTER.</h6>  <p class="hester speech">I dislike Mrs. Allonby.  I dislike her more than I can say.</p>

<h6 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p class="lady_caroline speech">I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like
yourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are
invited to meet.  Mrs. Allonby is very well born.  She is a niece of Lord
Brancaster’s.  It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she
was married.  But you know how unfair people often are.  I myself don’t
believe she ran away more than once.</p>
